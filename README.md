FaceKeyPoint Detection
====
A reimplementation of the paper Deep Convolutional Network Cascade for Facial Point Detection.

### Data

Download the [images]((http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/CNN_FacePoint.htm)) and extract to  `dataset` with `train` and `test`.

`level1.py, level2.py, level3.py` under `dataset` are the codes to gengrate the specific formate `*.h5` file for Caffe models.

### Train

`generate.py, *.template` under `prototxt` are the code and template to generate prototxt files for Caffe models.
`./level.py`will train the CNNs and use the mutilprocess to train level-2 and level-3. It will train every CNN seperately.

### Test

`run.py` under `test` use Caffe model to predict data.
`test.py` under `test` use Caffe model to predict keypoints and evaluate the mean error.
`show_w&fea.oy` under `test` are the code to visualize the filiters and feature maps.
`density_plot.py`under `test` are the code to polt the test-results density picture.

### Models

All model files generated by Caffe are under `model`, It contains all the check points intermediate results and the final `*.caffe`.

### Logs

All the results generated on the test images. Including `mean-error`, `Feature map` and `Filiters` Pictures.
